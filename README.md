# TechSith-React-Tutorial
Projects following along with TechSith Tutorials

Note: These projects are written in the following platform of Windows 7. I'm going to assume developers know how to recognize a windows 7 command, and are able to look up how to execute the commands on their own platform

Note2: Assuming you have react application installed after following the first project/video, the rest of the projects will assume you already have it installed.

Note3: For each project (with the exception of installing the react app package globally), I am using yarn instead of npm. So many of the commands I use in the readme(s) will be "yarn" (and assuming you have yarn installed)
