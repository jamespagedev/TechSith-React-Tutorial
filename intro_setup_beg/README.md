# React JS Introduction and Setup for Absolute Beginners

> video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUTsVY6VUQA

## Setup Instructions
* Open commandline interface in folder you want to start the project
* Assuming you have installed npm, execute the following command(s):
  * `npm install -g create-react-app` (-g is global, you won't need to run this for every project)
  * `create-react-app my-beautiful-react-app` (you can give it any project name you want)
  * `cd my-beautiful-react-app`
* Open your project in your favorite code editor (I personally use VS Code, by typing `code .` in the commandline while in the project directory)
* depending on you build package manager of choice, I prefer "yarn"... execute the command `yarn start` to see the project start up.
* Watch the video and take note of some of what the code is doing in your project files.
  * Note: it is okay if the project looks different than the one in the video, this is what happens when packages get updated
* To run test(s)... execute the command `yarn test`
  * press `q` to quit the test process after it passes.

Here is an example of what you should see after running a test...
